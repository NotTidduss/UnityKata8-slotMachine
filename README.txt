Unity Kata #8 - Slot machine

What is a slot machine?
The gambling demon one armed bandit features a screen displaying 3 or more 
reels that spin when the game begins.
On the reels, different symbols are displayed. When the reels stop
and any 3 symbols are aligned in a row, the player is rewarded by a custom prize.
Operations vary from machine to machine, this one will let player stop each
reel one by one.

Current features:
 * 3 reeled slots machine
 * result determination

ToDo:
- add documentation for playerprefs
- optimize UI script
- move reel settings to settings
- move result Text and Score out of SlotMachine
- fix snapping (snap wheel twice)
- add more ways to win (like cherry)
- make backend more generic = implement slotwheels # to be infinitable
